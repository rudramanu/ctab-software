## Introduction

This project is a simple 2-page website created using Node.js and an SQL database. It serves the purpose of demonstrating the implementation of fetching data from an external API, displaying it on webpages, and interacting with a database to store and retrieve information.

The core functionality of the project includes:

- Fetching user data from 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users' and displaying it on the home page.
- Storing user information into the database upon clicking the "Add" button and displaying the "Open" button if the user already exists in the database.
- Fetching post data for a specific user from 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=${userId}' and displaying it on the post page.
- Storing post information into the database upon clicking the "Bulk Add" button and allowing the user to download the post information in an Excel file.

This project aims to showcase the integration of Node.js, SQL database, and external APIs to build a functional web application.
